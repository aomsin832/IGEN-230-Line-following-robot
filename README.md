# Line-Following Robot with PD Control and Obstacle Detection

A line-following robot designed to track a line using five analog sensors, avoid obstacles using a sonar sensor, and steer with precise control using PD (Proportional-Derivative) algorithms. The robot uses two motors controlled by an H-bridge driver and an Arduino microcontroller for decision-making.

## Features

- **Line Tracking:** Uses 5 analog sensors to detect the position of a line and calculate the error for PD control.
- **PD Control Algorithm:** Provides smooth and precise steering by adjusting motor speeds based on proportional and derivative terms.
- **Obstacle Detection:** Employs an ultrasonic sonar sensor to detect obstacles and stop or avoid them.
- **Motor Control:** H-bridge driver enables direction and speed control of two DC motors using PWM signals.

## Usage

1. Place the robot on a track with a contrasting black line on a white surface.
2. Ensure the sensors are correctly aligned to detect the line.
3. Power on the robot.
4. The robot will follow the line while avoiding obstacles.
5. If an obstacle is detected, the robot will stop or perform a pre-programmed avoidance maneuver.
